Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia -- http://www.wikipedia.org/

Wikipedia is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia
project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on an openly
editable model. The name "Wikipedia" is a portmanteau of the words wiki
(a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian
word wiki, meaning "quick") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles
provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with
additional information.

Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous Internet
volunteers who write without pay. Anyone with Internet access can write
and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where
editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism. Users can
contribute anonymously, under a pseudonym, or, if they choose to, with
their real identity.
